# Credit-Card-Defaulters---PCA-and-Random-Forest
• Used Principal Component Analysis and Random-forest to find the credit card defaulters with 3% increased accuracy using a prior. • Cleaned the data and did the Exploratory Analysis. • Did feature engineering from the EDA done and added a new custom prior feature to improve the performance. • Used PCA to remove the irrelevant features • Applied the Random Forest Algorithm to decide whether a customer can be a defaulter soon.
